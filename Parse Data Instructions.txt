Parse data instructions

Some important things:
1. The data will be stored in JSON with no comments
2. The indent for the data will be 4
3. If there is anything wrong with the script, then it will not run properly.

Tree:
"""

    number:str
        key:str
        mode:str
        delay_next_key:int

What do these mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------
number: Command ID
(INTEGER)

Counts up from one.

Example: "8"
---------------------------------------------------------------
key: Key to send
(STRING)

If it is one character, then it will be handled normally. If it
is more than one character, it will be handled as a special 
character.

Example #1: "W"     (normal)
Example #2: "space" (special)
Example #3: "esc"   (special)
---------------------------------------------------------------
mode: What method to use
(STRING)

The mode will be the same as the method used in the auto typer
class. The methods that can be used are:
* send_key    (Just tap a key)
* hold_key    (Hold down a key)
* release_key (Release a key)

Example: "send_key"
---------------------------------------------------------------
delay_next_key: How many milliseconds to wait until next key
(INTEGER)

Example: 1000
---------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Title of the script
(STRING)

This is what will be showed when the user loads the script.

Example: "Hello, World!"
---------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Description of the script
(STRING)

This is what will be showed when the user loads the script.

Example: "Types out \"Hello, World!\""
---------------------------------------------------------------
Commands: How many commands in total to send
(INTEGER)

equal, then the script will not function properly.

Example: 13
